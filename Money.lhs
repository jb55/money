Data.Money
==========

> data Money a = Money !Double a

The money type allows you to perform calculations and currency conversions in a
type-safe way. The currency is a part of the type signature, so adding USD and
CAD would result in a type error.

Since `Currency` is a typeclass, you can define your own currency types with
custom exchange rates and it will work just fine.

Examples
--------

Define the Canadian/Euro currency with USD exchange rate

Specifying the exchange rate this way allows us to change the exchange rate on
the fly if needed

> cadC :: CAD
> cadC = CAD 1.00361

> eurC :: EUR
> eurC = EUR 1.3339

Helper function for dealing with Canadian/Euros

> eur :: Double -> Money EUR
> eur = money eurC

> cad :: Double -> Money CAD
> cad = money cadC

Convert 2000 CAD to EUR

> ex1 :: Money EUR
> ex1 = cad 2000 `to` eurC

Convert any money type to USD

> ex2 :: Money USD
> ex2 = toUSD ex1

Classes
-------

Minimal complete definition: only `xrate` needs to be defined

> class Currency a where
>   xrate   :: a -> ExchangeRate
>   toUSD   :: Money a -> Money USD
>   fromUSD :: a -> Money USD -> Money a
>   to    :: Currency b => Money a -> b -> Money b

>   a `to` b = fromUSD b $ toUSD a
>   toUSD m = toRate (cur m) USD m
>   fromUSD = fromRate USD

Currencies with an HasSign instance can be `Show`n

> class HasSign a where
>   sign :: a -> Sign


Instances
---------

> instance Eq (Money a) where
>   m1 == m2 = raw m1 == raw m2

> instance (Currency a, HasSign a, Show a) => Num (Money a) where
>   (+) = liftMoney (+)
>   (*) = liftMoney (*)
>   (-) = liftMoney (-)
>   negate m = money (cur m) . negate . raw $ m
>   abs m    = money (cur m) . abs . raw $ m
>   signum m = money (cur m) . signum . raw $ m
>   fromInteger i = undefined

> instance (Currency a, HasSign a, Show a) => Fractional (Money a) where
>   (/)  = liftMoney (/)
>   recip m = money (cur m) $ recip (raw m)
>   fromRational i = error "nope"

> instance (HasSign a, Show a) => Show (Money a) where
>   show m = let s = sign (cur m)
>                c = dbl m
>                c' = ' ':(show $ cur m)
>                negWrap s
>                  | raw m < 0 = "(" ++ s ++ ")"
>                  | otherwise = s
>            in case signPos s of
>              ToLeft  -> negWrap $ signSymbol s ++ show c ++ c'
>              ToRight -> negWrap $ show c ++ signSymbol s ++ c'

> instance Currency USD where
>   xrate _ = 1
>   toUSD  m = m
>   fromUSD _ m = m

> instance Currency CAD where
>   xrate (CAD x) = x

> instance Currency EUR where
>   xrate (EUR x) = x

> instance Default Sign where
>   def = toLeft "$"

> instance HasSign EUR where
>   sign _ = toLeft "â‚¬"

> instance HasSign CAD where
>   sign _ = def

> instance HasSign USD where
>   sign _ = def

Data
----

A simple currency sign definition, use `toLeft` and `toRight` to construct
these.

> data Sign = Sign {
>     signSymbol :: String
>   , signPos    :: Position
> } deriving (Show)

Position used for positioning currency signs when printing

> data Position = ToLeft | ToRight
>               deriving (Show)

Currencies
----------

Since the Currency typeclass uses the US dollar a reference point, we don't need
to define USD to have an `ExchangeRate` in its constructor

> data USD = USD
>          deriving (Show, Eq)

Canadian Dollar

> data CAD = CAD ExchangeRate
>          deriving (Show, Eq)

Euro

> data EUR = EUR ExchangeRate
>          deriving (Show, Eq)


Constructors
------------

> toRight :: String -> Sign
> toRight = flip Sign ToLeft

> toLeft :: String -> Sign
> toLeft = flip Sign ToLeft

> type ExchangeRate = Double

> money :: Currency a => a -> Double -> Money a
> money = flip Money

> round' n places = round (n / fromIntegral factor) * factor
>   where factor = 10 ^ (places - 1)

> dbl :: Money a -> Double
> dbl m
>   | c == 0    = 0.0
>   | otherwise = (fromIntegral (round $ c * 100)) / 100
>   where
>     c = raw m

> usd :: Double -> Money USD
> usd = money USD

> cur :: Money a -> a
> cur (Money _ c) = c

>                    rate = xrate a
>                in money b $ c * rate

> fromRate :: (Currency a, Currency b) => a -> b -> Money a -> Money b
> fromRate a b m = let c    = raw m
